This is a project for testing my skills after using the roadmap.sh Front-End Developer roadmap.

I created this portfolio website using HTML. The design follows best practices for accessibility and uses Semantic HTML.

You are free to judge me of my work. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. I'm here to help! Just comment in the repository comment section. I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

I will be updating the website with more projects and content soon. Stay tuned!

Thanks for checking out my portfolio!
